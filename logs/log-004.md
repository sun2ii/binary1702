## Prompt Run

Finalize and ship the StenoRacer MVP by:
- Completing core UX for Levels 1–3
- Locking scope on pricing and paywall
- Creating a minimal, honest marketing page
- Wiring Stripe Checkout for paid access
- Making conscious tradeoffs to ship tonight

Focus was on **correctness over completeness**.

- Implemented level selector, next-level navigation, and clean training loop
- Finalized single pricing plan ($20/month) to unlock Levels 2 + 3
- Created conversion-focused marketing page (no fluff, no overpromising)
- Designed and added StenoRacer logo
- Chose Phase-0 client-side unlock strategy (localStorage)
- Prepared Stripe Checkout + paywall integration
