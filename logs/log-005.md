## Prompt Run
- Simplify homepage to instant-play experience
- Remove sales friction from above the fold
- Initialize baseline SEO (indexing, sitemap, metadata)

## Output
- Updated landing copy to “Train steno speed”
- Homepage focused on immediate typing interaction
- SEO pages separated from homepage
- Sitemap created and submitted
- Search Console domain + URL-prefix properties verified

## Time Spent
~2.5 hours

## Why Stopped
SEO initialized and indexing in progress. Further changes would be premature; waiting for crawl and usage data before iterating.
