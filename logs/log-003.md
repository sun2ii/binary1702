  ## Prompt Run
  Add color-coded word type labels (prep, pron, aux, det) under each word in Sentence Practice page. Add settings toggle for:
  1. Show/hide word type labels
  2. Enable/disable shake on error

  Remove distracting animations (transition effects, success checkmark, "Press M" instruction). Keep red error flash only.

  ## Output
  - Added `getRoleInfo()` helper function mapping roles to labels + colors:
    - pron → cyan
    - aux → amber
    - prep → emerald
    - det → violet
  - Implemented settings gear icon (top right) with dropdown
  - Two checkboxes: "Show word types" and "Shake on error"
  - Removed `transition-all` causing unwanted word movement
  - Removed success checkmark (✓) and error text to prevent layout shift
  - Removed green background flash (kept red for errors)
  - Deleted "Press M" instruction below steno display
  - Created README.md with project overview, steno layout diagram, curriculum table
  - Committed and pushed to `origin/main`
