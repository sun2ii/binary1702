## Prompt Run
Scale the Japanese intent-based game by expanding scenarios while preserving a fixed, constrained input model.

## Output
- Designed an intent-based scenario taxonomy
- Implemented 38 playable scenarios across multiple real-world contexts
- Reused a small set of intent patterns without adding new controls
- Validated that scenarios resolve through intent recognition, not exact phrasing
- Preserved muscle-memory constraints and gameplay flow

## Time Spent
~2 hours

## Why Stopped
Core system validated. Cognitive saturation reached. Further scenario expansion can continue incrementally without architectural changes.
