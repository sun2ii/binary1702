# Binary1702

Public execution log.

What I build, when it ships, and why it stops.

## Purpose
Binary1702 is a lightweight record of completed work.  
Each entry documents a bounded execution session and its stopping point.

This is not a blog, portfolio, or roadmap.

## Structure
- `/logs/` — completed execution logs (immutable)
- Site — renders logs as a read-only viewer

## Status
Active.
